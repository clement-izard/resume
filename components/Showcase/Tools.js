          started in my third year and finished at the very end of my fifth, in parallel of other
          modules. This project was meant for gamers, more particularly competitive ones.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It was a dashboard where you could find players statistics for a specific game. I started
          with Counter Strike - Global Offensive. Steam was not providing past statistics, only the
          current ones. The only way to draw a graph was to refresh player data and save it in my
          database.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I choose MySQL because I was already used to it, after a while I found that MongoDB would
          have done the job better but it wasn't worth the time to change it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I used Koa.js as the Node.js server; mainly because it was Express.js developers who made
          it. Also because it looked cleaner. I quickly fallen into callback hell and Node's update
          about async/await was such an improvement I reworked it with this new syntax.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Already used to Angular, I found a dashboard template in Angular 2 for the Front, but
          later admitted that a rework in React could actually help develop it faster. Completely
          new to react I read the man and never used Angular ever since.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I added Socket.io to allow real time statistics across clients and Auth0 for Google,
          Facebook, Twitter and Steam authentications.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Another part of the app was the teams, they had their own statistics averaging the players
          inside. Searching for a player by it's statistics allowed the teams with a missing member
          to find the one they really needed.
